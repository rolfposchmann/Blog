_Hey there!_

I am a bachelor student living in Aachen, Germany. I study electrical engineering at university. My bachelor's field of specialization is micro- and nanoelectronics.

I enjoy writing code and I've also got a [GitHub](https://github.com/rolfposchmann) page with some of my projects. I am skilled in Python, C++, Embedded C , and I love working with Matlab.
